# My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) [2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)

I am mostly using [Janet](https://www.janet-lang.org/) this year. 
Some days may include additional implementations in other languages such as Ruby or Haskell or whatever else I felt like writing that day.

## How to run

`janet solution.janet` (reads input from a file called input.txt in the current working directory)
